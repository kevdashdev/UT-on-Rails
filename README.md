# [UT on Rails](http://schneems.com/ut-rails) course by Richard Schneeman
This Ruby on Rails course is 10 weeks long and assumes you know very little about programming and have not used Ruby, Rails, or Databases previously. The videos are broken up by topic, so if you know one topic you can safely skip that video. Some weeks have exercises and quizes, this is the most important part of the course. Learning a new programming language or framework is like learning a new language, you have to practice to get good at it.
